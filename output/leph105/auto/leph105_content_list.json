However, they interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called domain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a net magnetisation. Typical domain size is lmm and the domain contains about $1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly from domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown in Fig. 5.8(a). When we apply an external magnetic field $\\mathbf { B } _ { 0 }$ ,the domains orient themselves in the direction of $\\mathbf { B } _ { 0 }$ and simultaneously the domain oriented in the direction of $\\mathbf { B } _ { 0 }$ grow in size. This existence of domains and their motion in $\\mathbf { B } _ { 0 }$ are not speculations. One may observe this under a microscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered ferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be observed. Fig. 5.8(b) shows the situation when the domains have aligned and amalgamated to form a single 'giant' domain. ",

However, there exists no classical theory which ties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory by Bardeen, Cooper,and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. The BCS theory was proposed inl957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel Prize in physics in 1970.   \n6. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it is weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.   \n7. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic,and ferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic material such as ferrimagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with properties which are exotic and mysterious. ",
