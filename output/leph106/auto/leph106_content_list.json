        "text": "Electricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated phenomena for a long time. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others established the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They found that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example, an electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity. This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible? Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit such a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is resounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and Joseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated conclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when subjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the phenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand the underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is generated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called electromagnetic induction. ",

The deflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion. The galvanometer does not show any deflection when the magnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled away from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in the opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the current's direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of the bar magnet is moved towards or away from the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite to that observed with the North-pole for similar movements. Further, the deflection (and hence current) is found to be larger when the magnet is pushed towards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead, when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ is moved towards or away from the magnet, the same effects are observed.

The change in magnetic flux induces emf in coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ . It was this induced emf which caused electric current to flow in coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and through the galvanometer. A plausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is as follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a maximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic flux through the neighbouring coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ also increases. It is the change in magnetic flux through coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ that produces an induced emf in coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ when the key is held pressed, current in coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ is constant. Therefore, there is no change in the magnetic flux through coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and the current in coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ drops to zero. when the key is released, the current in $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ and the resulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a short time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and hence again induces an electric current in coil $\\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } ^ { * }$ . The common point in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic flux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental observations in the form of a law called Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The law is stated below. ",

In Fig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed towards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is induced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux. This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet. Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity towards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the Northpole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux, the induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its Southpole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the corresponding decrease in flux. ",

Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or induced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field generates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields produced by static electric charges have properties different from those produced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that charges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet. Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing magnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the fundamental significance of the Faraday's discovery. Electricity and magnetism are related. ",

The modern ac generator with a typical output capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine. In this section, we shall describe the basic principles behind this machine. The Yugoslav inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the development of the machine. As was pointed out in Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf or current in a loop is through a change in the loop's orientation or a change in its effective area. As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the effective area of the loop (the face perpendicular to the field) is $A$ cos $\\theta _ { \\ast }$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between A and B. This method of producing a flux change is the principle of operation of a simple ac generator. An ac generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. ",

        "text": "1. Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the nineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others established that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field. Somewhat later, around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry demonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.   \n2. In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the changing magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy. However, in case of an open circuit, an emf is induced across its ends. How is it related to the flux change?   \n3. The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently from Faraday's law using the Lorentz force on moving charges. However, even if the charges are stationary [and the q $\\bf ( v \\times \\bf \\delta B )$ term of the Lorentz force is not operativel, an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static charges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for Faraday's law. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle of relativity for Faraday's law. ",
